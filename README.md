# TypeScript Architecture Sheriff

Like automated testing can be more effective at ensuring behavior
than documentation, linters can be more effective at enforcing code
styles than code reviews.

The TypeScript Architecture Sheriff aims at enforcing a set of rules
over module dependencies on a TypeScript project.
This way, project collaborators can be guided to check if the change
being introduced in the architecture is correct before the code review.
